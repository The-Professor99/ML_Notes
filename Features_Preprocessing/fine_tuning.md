After all the fine tuning, it would be good to ensure that your model not only works well on average, but also on all categories. Eg in our test project, the model should work on all categories of districts, whether they’re rural or urban, rich or poor, North or South, minority or not, etc. This requires a bit of work creating subsets of your validation set for each category, but it’s important: if your model performs poorly on a whole category of districts, then it should probably not be deployed until the issue is solved, or at least it should not be used to make predictions for that category, as it may do more harm than good.
