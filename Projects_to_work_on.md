#### ML Projects To work on
_(Curated by chatgpt)_

1. House Price Prediction: Develop a regression model to predict house prices based on features like the number of rooms, location, square footage, etc. This project will familiarize you with regression algorithms and feature engineering.

2. Image Classification with Transfer Learning: Use transfer learning to create an image classification model using pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or Inception. You can fine-tune the model on a custom dataset. This project will teach you about transfer learning and how to leverage pre-trained models effectively.

3. Recommendation System: Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items (movies, books, products) to users based on their past preferences or behaviors. This project will introduce you to collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques. 

4. Sentiment Analysis with LSTM/GRU: Create a sentiment analysis model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks. Use a dataset of movie reviews or tweets to predict whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Image Generation: Build a GAN model to generate realistic images, such as faces, bedrooms, or artworks. Explore architectures like Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) or Progressive GANs for more advanced results.

6. Stock Price Prediction: Build a model that predicts stock prices based on historical price data, trading volume, and other relevant features. You can use time series forecasting techniques like ARIMA, SARIMA, or advanced machine learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for this project.
