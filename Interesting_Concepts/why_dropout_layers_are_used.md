Dropout layers are commonly used as a regularization technique as they involve randomly "dropping out"(i.e, setting to zero) some units during training. When units are randomly dropped out during training, the network is forced to rely on a more diverse set of features and cannot become overly dependent on a specific subset of neurons.
